CS4121 Cminus Expression Interpreter Project

written by liang yan

1. Change all the project to C++ platform, so please run 
by my own Makefile which is tested by campus computer.

2. File CminusScanner.l

add variable for IDENTIFIER and INTCON and STRING, so
we could get right value from bison part.


3. File CminusParse.y

add a map structure for varable, so we could get a int value from a
string variable.

add union part for bison,

add type configuration for bison

change assignment part to output right answer.

change each expression (logic operation, comparison operation regular operation
and so on)

change variable string constant part to get right value from flex.
